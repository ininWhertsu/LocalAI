# T Splines For Rhino 5: A Powerful Tool for Surface Modeling
 
T Splines is a plugin for Rhinoceros 5 that allows you to create smooth and organic surfaces with ease. T Splines uses a novel technology called T-NURCCs, which are a generalization of NURBS that can handle arbitrary topology and local refinement. With T Splines, you can create complex shapes with fewer control points, edit them intuitively with direct manipulation, and convert them to NURBS or meshes for downstream applications.
